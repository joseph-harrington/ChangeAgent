ChangeAgent is a dynamic system simulation application that runs on desktop.  It simulates a system comprised of autonomous agents which interact with other agents, changing state.  The user may modify the system operaton parameters and observe the system response.  A dashboard monitors the system state with animated bar graphs.  Refer to the User Guide and Design Specification for further information.
